# Tic-Tac-Toe
This program is a concise and interactive console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.
## Description
This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. 
It provides an interactive two-player experience where players can take turns marking their moves on a 3x3 grid. The program validates inputs,
checks for a winner after each move, and declares the winning player when a row, column, or diagonal is filled with their symbol ('X' or 'O'). 
If no player wins and all cells are filled, the game ends in a draw. The program displays the current state of the board after each move, making it an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience.

## Features
- User-friendly console interface.
- Input validation to ensure valid moves.
- Real-time display of the game board after each move.
- Announces the winning player or a draw at the end of the game.
- Supports two-player gameplay.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example:
   ```shell
   g++ -o Tic-Tac-Toe tictok.cpp
Usage
Players take turns entering their moves by selecting a number from 1 to 9, corresponding to the cell they want to mark.
The game will display the updated board after each move.
The first player to fill a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol wins the game.
If no player wins and all cells are filled, the game ends in a draw.
